Pseudocode Input
A program that prints all numbers up to an inputted number might look:
    1 When the user inputs a number
    2 Initialize a counter variable and set its value to zero
    3 While counter is smaller than user inputted number incremented the 
      counter by one.
    4 Print the value of the counter variable

- Plan
Browser console program - no interface
Only user interaction user entering a number 
Input user will enter number from a prompt (popup box)
Output is a list of numbers from 1 to number user entered
Numbers divisable by 3 output Fizz
Numbers divisable by 5 output Buzz
Numbers divisable by 3 and 5 output FizzBuzz

Pseudocode Output
    1 When a user inputs a number
    2 Loop from 1 to entered number
    3 If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
    4 If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
    5 If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
    6 Otherwise print the current number
