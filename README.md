Project Title: Rock Paper Scissors Game

Description:
This project implements the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors, built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. The game allows a player to compete against a computer opponent. This iteration focuses on applying fundamental JavaScript concepts, including functions, loops and conditional statements, and played entirely in the browser console and user interface.


Features:

    Player vs. Computer: Play against an AI opponent that makes random choices.
    Interactive UI: Engage with the game through a browset console interface built with HTML, and JavaScript.
    Score Tracking: Keep track of player and computer scores throughout the game.
    Round-by-Round Feedback: Receive clear messages indicating the winner of each round.
    Game End Condition: The game concludes when it reaches a predetermined game count of 5.
    Reset Functionality: Refresh the browser to reset the game and play again. 

Technologies Used:

    HTML5: For structuring the web page.
    JavaScript (ES6+): For implementing game logic, console and player interaction.

    Reinforce fundamental JavaScript concepts (functions, variables, control flow).
    Practice.
    Develop a basic understanding of game logic and state management.
    Console interaction with no GUI yet, weâ€™ll create the GUI in later lessons.
