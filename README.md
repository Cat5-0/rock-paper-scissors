Pseudocode Input
A program that creates a game played entirely in the console:
    1 Game played against the computer.
    2 A funtion that randomly returns "rock", "paper" or "scissors".
    3 Create a new function named getComputerChoice
    4 getComputerChoice will randomly return "rock", "paper" or "scissors".
      (Hint Math.random to conditionally return one of the multiple choices).
    5 Test function returns expected results using console.log
    6 Step 3 Write the logic to get human choice
    7 Create a new function named getHumanChoice
    8 getHumanChoice to return one of the valid choices depending on user input
      (Hint use the prompt method to get user input, assume user always enters valid input)
    9 Test function returns expected results using console.log


- Plan
Calculate random number range 1 to 3
Create new function named getComputerChoice
If randomNumber is 1 console.log "Rock"
If randomNumber is 2 console.log "Paper"
If randomNumber is 3 console.log "Scissors"


Pseudocode Output
Calculate random number range 1 to 3
Create new function named getComputerChoice
If randomNumber is 1 console.log "Rock"
If randomNumber is 2 console.log "Paper"
If randomNumber is 3 console.log "Scissors"
