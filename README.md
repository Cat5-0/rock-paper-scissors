Project Title: Rock Paper Scissors Game

Revisit - 

Game refactored to Browser UI.

Description:
This project implements the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors, built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. The game allows a player to compete against a computer opponent. This iteration focuses on applying fundamental JavaScript concepts, including functions, loops and conditional statements, and played entirely in the browser.


Features:

    Player vs. Computer: Play against an AI opponent that makes random choices.
    Interactive UI: Engage with the game through a browser interface built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
    Score Tracking: Keep track of player and computer scores throughout the game.
    Round-by-Round Feedback: Receive clear messages indicating the winner of each round.
    Game End Condition: The game concludes when it reaches a predetermined game count of 5.
    Reset Functionality: Refresh the browser to reset the game and play again. 

Technologies Used:

    HTML5: For structuring the web page.
    CSS: For styling.
    JavaScript (ES6+): For implementing game logic, console and player interaction.
